									<div class="content">
										<blockquote>Joell is a force behind our product-ivity. Thanks to her, my day is considerably easier with her design prototyping, requirements wrangling, user engagement, conflict resolution, and team leadership efforts.
											Bob Loblaw and Peter A Venkman have achieved more for our product growth than we thought possible, thanks to Joell’s unique “Let’s Shepp it!” approach to product management.  Joell finds effective and clever ways to facilitate
											velocity and priority through personas, designs, and requirements with key stakeholders. Any leader with a strong vision, would find Joell to be one of those people that can navigate the maze and make a real product contender for them.

									<h3>Life On Mars</h3>
									<h4>Julio Santos, CEO</h4>
									<div class="content">
										<blockquote> I've been fortunate to work under Joell's product direction on two separate projects. She is hands down the most thorough product owner I saw at work. Every question the developers could possibly have about the product had
											been thought of beforehand, and expounded clear and eloquently. Joell has the gift of empathy, which in addition to communicating with a development team, is a fantastic asset when it comes to really understanding the audience for a product.
											As the meme goes, any successful venture needs to not only build the thing right, but also build the right thing. With Joell at the helm, building the right thing is par for the course.
