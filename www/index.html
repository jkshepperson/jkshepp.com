				<!-- My Background -->
					<section class="spotlight style2 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center" id="first">
						<div class="content">
							<h2><span class="brandColor">My Background</span></h2>
							<p>With a background in psychology, sociology and conflict resolution, I bring a unique approach to solving problems and have over 10 years experience in healthcare, clinical trials, development services, and entertainment industries and am especially skilled at incorporating the newest AI technologies into our experience. Outside of formal training, I am a student of my craft and prefer well researched books over blog posts.</p>

				<!-- My Process -->
					<section class="spotlight style2 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center">
						<div class="content">
							<h2><span class="brandColor">My Process</span></h2>
							<p>There is a method to my madness and that method is rooted in lean, agile product development. I believe that behind the best teams lives a process that encourages and supports positive brainstorming and open, honest communication. My personal style starts with empathy and ends with delivery, with a healthy dose of cross-team collaboration sprinkled throughout.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h2><span class="brandColor">My Values</span></h2>
							<p>In the office and out, my mantra is simple: do the right thing. This means I approach work and projects with honesty, transparency and seek to involve my fellow colleagues early and often in my designs. I am heavily involved in my local community and am especially passionate about improving access to addiction treatment and creating tech opportunities for some of our smaller cities and towns.</p>

							<h2><span class="brandColor">My Side Hustles</span></h2>
							<p>Although my heart will always have a place for UX, I am also an avid crafts-woman and founded Dune Dog Collective in 2019 to take my passion project more mainstream. At Dune Dog, we focus on recycling glassware and homegoods to make them new again using our sandblaster to create custom designs.</p>

										<h6>User Journeys</h6>

										<h6>Wireframes</h6>
										<p>Sometimes your developers move to fast for high fidleity and in that case I switch to low fidelity wireframes to keep us moving. Here is a sample wireframe for a new product using AI to better cast talent in Hollywood in 2019.</p>

										<blockquote>Joell is a force behind our product-ivity. Thanks to her, my day is considerably easier with her design prototyping, requirements wrangling, user engagement, conflict resolution, and team leadership efforts.
											Bob Loblaw and Peter A Venkman have achieved more for our product growth than we thought possible, thanks to Joell’s unique “Let’s Shepp it!” approach to product management.  Joell finds effective and clever ways to facilitate
											velocity and priority through personas, designs, and requirements with key stakeholders. Any leader with a strong vision, would find Joell to be one of those people that can navigate the maze and make a real product contender for them.

									<h3>Julio Santos</h3>
									<h5>Life on Mars, CEO</h5>
									<div class="content">
										<blockquote> I've been fortunate to work under Joell's product direction on two separate projects. She is hands down the most thorough product owner I saw at work. Every question the developers could possibly have about the product had
											been thought of beforehand, and expounded clear and eloquently. Joell has the gift of empathy, which in addition to communicating with a development team, is a fantastic asset when it comes to really understanding the audience for a product.
											As the meme goes, any successful venture needs to not only build the thing right, but also build the right thing. With Joell at the helm, building the right thing is par for the course.
